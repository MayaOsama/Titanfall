# Titanfall
Titanfall is a first person shooter (FPS) game. The player plays as a free-running foot soldier "Pilots" who can command agile, mech-style robots called "Titans". Pilots are agile with great mobility options and weaponry. While Titans are signicantly less mobile than the pilots, they have stronger rearms and superior protection. The player initially starts as a Pilot, but can later deploy and enter a Titan after killing enough enemies.
